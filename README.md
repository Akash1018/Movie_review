# Movie CRUD Application

Welcome to the Movie CRUD Application GitHub repository. This project is a web application that allows users to search for movies, rate them, and manage a list of movies they have watched and want to watch. It is built with React for the frontend and uses a SQL database as the primary source of truth for movie information and user ratings.

## Features

- **React Frontend**: The application's frontend is built with React, providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the movie database.

- **SQL Database**: We use an SQL database to store and retrieve movie information, including titles, ratings, and user information.

- **Movie Search**: The application incorporates a movie search functionality that fetches data from third-party APIs, such as IMDb. A script is provided to fetch approximately 10,000 movies and store them in the SQL database.

- **User Ratings**: Users can rate movies they have watched, and these ratings are stored in the SQL database.

- **Synthetic Data Generation**: In this project, synthetic data for approximately 10,000 users who have watched around 50,000 movies is created. This data is entirely random and helps simulate a large user base.
